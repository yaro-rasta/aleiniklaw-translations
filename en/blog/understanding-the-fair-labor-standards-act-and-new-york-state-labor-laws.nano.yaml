        a: Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
      - " is foundational to federal labor law, establishing minimum wage,
        overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards. This act
        covers employees in both the private sector and various levels of
        government, ensuring workers receive a federal minimum wage of $7.25 per
        hour. Should state and federal minimum wages differ, employees are
        entitled to the higher of the two."
  - p:
      - "The FLSA mandates that nonexempt employees receive overtime pay at a
        rate of one and a half times their regular pay for hours worked beyond
        40 in a workweek. Importantly, there is no limit on the number of hours
        that employees aged 16 and older can work per week, and the FLSA does
        not require overtime pay for work done during weekends or holidays
        unless these days happen to coincide with overtime hours. Employers are
        also required to display an "

  - p: Youth employment under the FLSA is carefully regulated with minimum age
      requirements set at 14 for non-agricultural positions, and limitations
      placed on the hours and types of work available to minors to protect their
      educational opportunities and health.
  - h2: New York State Labor Laws
  - p: In New York State, labor laws complement federal standards but include
      several unique provisions. In areas like New York City, Long Island, and
      Westchester, the minimum wage is $15.00 per hour, whereas other parts of
      the state have a minimum wage of $13.20, progressively increasing annually
      until it meets the $15.00 threshold. Similarly, New York requires overtime
      pay at one and a half times the regular rate after 40 hours per week, and
      sets specific payment frequencies for different categories of workers.
  - p: Child labor in New York also has specific guidelines, with working papers
      required for minors aged 14-17, and mandatory school attendance enforced
      until they reach the age of 16. Regarding sick leave, New York employers
      must provide up to 56 hours of paid sick leave annually, depending on the
      size of the business and the employerâ€™s net income.

        a: Department of Labor
      - " plays a vital role in enforcing these standards, investigating claims
        for unpaid or withheld wages, and taking action against employers for
        any labor law violations. This includes hefty penalties for underpayment
        or failure to adhere to child labor provisions, with potential fines
        reaching up to $10,000 per violation and serious consequences such as
        criminal charges and civil penalties for repeated or willful
        violations."
  - h2: Penalties and Compliance in New York
  - p: New York State also imposes its own penalties for labor law infractions,
      which can include payment of back wages, liquidated damages, and
      substantial fines for denying proper wage payments or failing to provide
      mandated benefits like meal breaks or safe working conditions.
  - p: For employers, understanding these legal requirements is crucial to maintain
      compliance and avoid significant legal and financial consequences. For
      employees, knowing these rights ensures they can advocate effectively for
      fair treatment in the workplace. Both federal and state labor laws serve
      as a safeguard, promoting fair labor practices and protecting workers
      across various industries.
