  - p: Mayor Eric Adams has launched “Operation Padlock to Protect,” a new
      initiative empowering the sheriff’s office, NYPD, and the Department of
      Consumer and Worker Protection to closely inspect and potentially seal any
      businesses selling cannabis without a valid license. This move aims to
      address the growing number of unlicensed cannabis shops, which have
      continued to operate despite existing regulations.
  - p: Despite efforts to regulate the burgeoning illegal market, the first empty
      storefront survey by W42ST in the spring of 2023 revealed 41 unlicensed
      smoke shops in Hell’s Kitchen alone, a number that rose to 50 by the fall.
      The mayor had hoped that this initiative would rapidly reduce the number
      of unlicensed shops. However, the actual timeline has proven more
      challenging than expected, with the city managing to seal 75 shops to
      date.
  - p: The crackdown has faced significant pushback from affected business owners,
      who claim that the padlocking process violates their constitutional rights
      by lacking sufficient judicial oversight. In response, 27 businesses have
      filed a class-action lawsuit against the city, arguing that the
      enforcement measures deny them due process and demand both an injunction
      against these practices and compensation for losses incurred.
  - p: Legal experts and the businesses involved criticize the licensing process as
      overly restrictive, leading to unsold legal products and allowing
      unregulated stores to dominate the market. Following a task force report
      led by Jeanette Moy from the Office of General Services, it was revealed
      that there is a significant backlog in license approvals, with more than
      5,600 applications still pending since August 2022. This has prompted
      recommendations for increased staffing and a streamlined denial system to
      expedite the licensing process.
  - p: Further complicating matters, Attorney Lance Lazzaro, representing the
      plaintiffs, argues that hearings on these closures should be held in a
      court of law rather than through administrative offices, which he claims
      are influenced by city politics. There have also been criticisms regarding
      the NYPD’s enforcement methods, particularly concerning searches and
      seizures conducted without warrants.
  - p: In an effort to bolster the legal cannabis market and protect public safety,
      Governor Kathy Hochul has announced new initiatives under the FY25 Enacted
      Budget, giving local municipalities and the Office of Cannabis Management
      (OCM) enhanced authority to act against illicit operations. This includes
      the ability to padlock businesses immediately following an inspection if
      they pose an imminent threat, such as selling to minors or operating too
      close to schools.
  - p: The city maintains that these stringent measures are essential for closing
      down illegal operations and supporting legal cannabis business owners who
      comply with state regulations. Despite the ongoing legal challenges and
      debates, city officials and the state government are determined to
      establish a controlled, safe, and thriving legal cannabis market in New
      York City.
