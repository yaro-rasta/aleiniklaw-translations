      Olga Aleinik"
  - p: Contracts form the backbone of modern commerce, laying the groundwork for
      trusted business relations and ensuring that parties uphold their
      promises. A well-crafted contract is not only a formal agreement but also
      a peacekeeper and a blueprint for the successful completion of business
      deals. However, when one party fails to fulfill their contractual
      obligations, it leads to a breach, which can disrupt business operations
      and result in significant losses. Attorney Olga Aleinik of Aleinik Law
      Firm provides expert insights into how breach of contract unfolds in New
      York and how affected parties can seek redress.
  - h2: What Constitutes a Contract?
  - p: "A contract in New York, as elsewhere, is formed through three fundamental
      steps: an offer, acceptance of that offer, and the exchange of
      consideration (something of value). These elements ensure that each party
      is bound legally, making a contract enforceable in a court of law."
  - h2: "Breach of Contract: What Needs to be Proved?"
  - p: "To successfully claim a breach of contract in New York, a party must
      demonstrate:"
  - ol:
      - "Existence of a Contract: Clear evidence that a contract existed between
        the parties involved."
      - "Performance by the Claimant: The party claiming the breach must show
        that they fulfilled their contractual obligations."
      - "Failure to Perform by the Defendant: It must be evident that the other
        party failed to meet their contractual commitments materially."
      - "Resulting Damages: There must be measurable losses resulting from the
        breach."
  - h2: Common Breaches in the Construction Industry
  - p: "In the construction sector, breaches can be particularly impactful,
      potentially causing delays and financial losses. Common issues include:"
  - ol:
      - "Defective Performance: Work that is substandard or does not meet the
        specifications outlined in the contract."
      - "Schedule and Delay Issues: Not adhering to the timeline agreed upon,
        affecting project completion."
      - "Failure to Perform: Not completing the work or providing the services
        stipulated in the contract."
  - h2: Legal Remedies for Breach of Contract
  - p: "When a breach occurs, the non-breaching party has several potential
      remedies:"
  - ol:
      - "Damages: Financial compensation for losses incurred due to the breach."
      - "Rescission: The contract is canceled, and both parties are returned to
        their pre-contractual state."
      - "Reformation: The contract is rewritten to more accurately reflect what
        the parties intended."
      - "Specific Performance: A court order requiring the breaching party to
        fulfill their obligations as per the contract."
  - h2: "Before You Sue: Considerations and Steps"
  - p: Not every contract dispute warrants a lawsuit. Itâ€™s crucial to review the
      contract thoroughly for any dispute resolution clauses that might require
      mediation or arbitration before legal action can be initiated.
      Additionally, for lesser disputes, small claims court can offer a quicker,
      more cost-effective solution.
  - p:
      - "However, if a lawsuit becomes necessary, unless it qualifies for small
        claims court, the complexity of legal proceedings typically requires
        professional legal assistance. This is where the expertise of a seasoned
        attorney becomes invaluable. "
